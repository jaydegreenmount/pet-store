"# pet-store" 


A Drupal 8 project from my internship that I completed in May/June 2019.
A few of the rules I had to follow below.

* Drupal 8 Composer based site
* Create a custom module to get "friends" lastest blog post
* A single post must be a renderable array using my own custom twig file
* Blank omega sub theme
* SASS to be used to write CSS
* Must use custom UI kit from company as much as possible
* Images should be resized by website automatically
* Follow Frames provided
